                  <p>By signing up you get a choice of complimentary cocktails*, smoothies or desserts for you and five friends on your birthday and half birthday - that’s over a whopping £80** free a year to spend on yummy treats! </p>
                  <p><br />
                    The Celebrations Club also keeps members up to date on promotions and events at their favourite Fridays, meaning you won’t miss out on anything! Those who are already signed up to the TGI Fridays Birthday Club will automatically be enrolled in the Celebrations Club, but for those that want to join <a href="https://www.tgifridays.co.uk/celebrations" target="_blank">just head here</a> and register your details. </p>
