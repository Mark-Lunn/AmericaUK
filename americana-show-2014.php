              <td><p>The <strong>Americana International Festival </strong>is Europe’s #1 American lifestyle event and it just keeps on growing. The show regularly attracts more than 30,000 weekender’s, exhibitors and day visitors.</p>
                <p>This massive tribute to the USA is unique in its widely ranging attractions that appeal to tens of thousands of like-minded people from all over the world. For well over three decades the event has given its faithful supporters a long weekend of cool American music, great cars, motorcycles, trucks, RV’s from the early 1900s to the present.</p>
                <p>Organisers Chris &amp; Bev Jackson, from Stapleford Nottingham, are both confirmed classic car and bike nuts. Long standing club members of the two biggest American car clubs in the country (AACUK &amp; AACNW), they have turned this one time small local show into the biggest and longest running event of its kind in Europe.</p>
                <p>By taking a slice of the ‘American Dream’ they have created an amazing weekend that has no equal anywhere outside of the USA. Much more than a car show or music festival it’s all of these combined into one massive fun-filled family event.</p>
                <p>The Saturday and Sunday auto/bike displays are second to none with a huge number of top class cars and motorcycles entering the specially judged ‘show and shine’ displays. With forty prestigious awards on offer competition will be strong.</p>
                <p>For those who love the music of the 50s, 60s , 70s and 80s the 2013 event had forty-two popular artistes from the USA/EUROPE/UK performing a great mixture of rock’n'roll/country/r&amp;b/blues/alternative music from the last five decades.</p>
                <p>Mix all that with hundreds associated trade stands, Fashion Show hosted by boobookitty couture, side-shows, amusements, auto/bike club displays, children’s amusements, talent contests, Ride The Raging Bull, Flight Simulators, tattooist, line-dance &amp; jive tuition, on site camping facilities, four bars, high quality food vendors &amp; so much more to see and do.</p>
                <p>Anyone wishing to attend the event as an auto/bike exhibitor should request the correct entry form. We can be contacted by telephone or email. Alternatively it is possible to download booking forms from our web site.</p>
